# Java RMI

This is an assignment for a university course called Distributed Systems. Java RMI is used to create a simple hotel room management application. The user connects to the server using the client cli in order to manage the reservations. The user has the ability to:
- reserve a room (using `book`)
- cancel a reservation (using `cancel`)
- list available rooms (using `list`) and
- list guests along with their reservations (using `guests`)
